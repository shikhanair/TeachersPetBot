| Grading Points|Self-Assessment|Links|
|-----|---------|-----|
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 
| Number of commits|
| Number of commits: by different people|
| Issues reports: there are **many**|
|  issues are being  closed| 3 | 
| DOI badge: exists |
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
